Problem Statement:

The goal is to predict the price of gold (GLD) using a machine learning model. This is a regression problem where the model learns the relationship between GLD and other financial indicators like Silver (SLV), S&P 500 (SPX), Crude Oil (USO), and USD Index (USDI) to make accurate predictions.

Preprocessing:

The code first loads and explores the dataset. It analyzes the correlation between features to understand their relationships. Then, it prepares the data for modeling by separating features (X) from the target (Y) â€“ which is the gold price (GLD). Finally, it splits the data into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation.

Model Performance:

A Random Forest Regressor model is trained to predict gold prices. The model's performance is measured using the R-squared error. This metric quantifies how well the model's predictions match the actual gold prices. A higher R-squared score indicates better predictive accuracy. A plot visually compares the actual and predicted values to assess the model's performance.
